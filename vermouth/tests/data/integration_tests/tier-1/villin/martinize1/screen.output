INFO       Written 1 ITP file
INFO       Output contains 1 molecules:
INFO          1->  Protein_A (chain  A)
INFO       Written topology files
INFO       The elnedyn forcefield has been implemented with some changes compared to the published parameters:
INFO       - Backbone-Backbone bonds use high force constant bonds instead of constraints.
INFO       - Trp has an extra constrain added to the sidechain.
INFO       - The Backbone sidechain bonds with high force constants are replaced by constraints except for Trp and His.
INFO       - Cysteine bonds are 0.24 nm constraints, instead of the published 0.39nm/5000kJ/mol.
WARNING    Elnedyn topologies might not give numerical stable simulations with a 20fs timestep.
WARNING    This can be solved by setting all S-type bead masses to 72amu.
WARNING    Martini version 2.2 is in beta release. It has not been extensively tested and problems might occur.

	There you are. One MARTINI. Shaken, not stirred.


And when that first martini hits the liver like a silver bullet, there is a sigh of contentment that can be heard in Dubuque.

INFO       The Elnedyn forcefield has been implemented with some changes compared to the published parameters:
INFO       - Backbone-Backbone bonds use high force constant bonds instead of constraints.
INFO       - Trp has an extra constrain added to the sidechain.
INFO       - The Backbone sidechain bonds with high force constants are replaced by constraints except for Trp and His.
INFO       - Cysteine bonds are 0.24 nm constraints, instead of the published 0.39nm/5000kJ/mol.
WARNING    Elnedyn topologies might not give numerical stable simulations with a 20fs timestep.
WARNING    This can be solved by setting all S-type bead masses to 72amu.

        There you are. One MARTINI. Shaken, not stirred.


The chromatic scale is what you use to give the effect of drinking a quinine martini and having an enema simultaneously.
